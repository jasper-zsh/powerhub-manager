# Feature Specification: Flutter App for BLE-Controlled 4-Channel PWM Controller

**Feature Branch**: `001-flutter-ble-4`  
**Created**: Thursday, September 18, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ÂàõÂª∫‰∏Ä‰∏™flutterÈ°πÁõÆÔºåÁî®‰∫éÈÄöËøáBLEÊéßÂà∂‰∏Ä‰∏™4Ë∑ØPWMÊéßÂà∂Âô®ÔºåÂπ∂ÁºñÊéíÈ¢ÑËÆæ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to control a 4-channel PWM device via Bluetooth Low Energy from my smartphone so that I can adjust lighting or motor speeds remotely. I also want to create and manage presets for quick configuration of all channels.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the app is installed and the PWM controller is powered on, **When** the user opens the app and connects to the device via BLE, **Then** the app displays controls for all 4 PWM channels
2. **Given** the user is connected to the PWM controller, **When** the user adjusts any channel's PWM value, **Then** the corresponding channel output on the device updates in real-time
3. **Given** the user has configured a desired set of PWM values, **When** the user saves these as a preset with a name, **Then** the preset is stored and can be recalled later
4. **Given** the user has created one or more presets, **When** the user selects a preset from the list, **Then** all 4 PWM channels update to the values defined in that preset

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the BLE connection is lost during use?
- How does the system handle attempting to connect to a device that is out of range?
- What happens when a user tries to save a preset with a name that already exists?
- How does the system behave when the PWM controller is powered off while connected?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to scan for and connect to BLE-enabled 4-channel PWM controllers
- **FR-002**: System MUST display real-time controls for all 4 PWM channels with values between 0-100%
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to adjust PWM values for each channel independently through sliders or input fields
- **FR-004**: System MUST send updated PWM values to the device in real-time as they are adjusted
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to create, name, and save presets that store the state of all 4 channels
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to view a list of saved presets and apply any preset with a single action
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide visual feedback when connected to a device (e.g., indicator light or status text)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle connection errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to users
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to disconnect from the device manually
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist saved presets between app sessions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **PWM Controller**: A Bluetooth Low Energy device with 4 channels that can output PWM signals with adjustable duty cycles from 0-100%
- **Channel**: One of the 4 outputs of the PWM controller, each with an adjustable duty cycle value
- **Preset**: A named configuration that stores specific PWM values for all 4 channels to allow quick recall of lighting/motor setups
- **BLE Connection**: The wireless connection between the smartphone and the PWM controller that enables control signals to be sent
