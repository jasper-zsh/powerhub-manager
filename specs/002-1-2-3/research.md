# Research Log — Optimized Device Connection Management

## Testing Harness Expectations

- **Decision**: Align new tests with the existing `flutter_test`-based unit, integration, and widget test structure.  
- **Rationale**: The repository’s `/app/test` directory contains unit and integration suites that already import `package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart`, indicating precedent and tooling support. Staying consistent minimises setup overhead and keeps CI expectations unchanged.  
- **Alternatives considered**: 
  - Adding the official `integration_test` package harness — discarded because no current tests reference it and would require additional configuration.
  - Relying solely on manual QA — rejected; project emphasises TDD and existing suites expect automated coverage.

## Constitution Guidance

- **Decision**: Proceed under the assumption that no additional constitutional gates apply until a populated constitution file is provided. Document this assumption and flag future updates for re-evaluation.  
- **Rationale**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` contains only placeholders with no enforceable principles, leaving no actionable compliance criteria. Capturing the assumption keeps the plan moving while remaining transparent.  
- **Alternatives considered**: 
  - Defining bespoke gates ad hoc — rejected to avoid introducing rules without stakeholder approval.
  - Blocking work pending constitution update — discarded because it would stall delivery without clear governance direction.
