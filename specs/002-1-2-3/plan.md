# Implementation Plan: Optimized Device Connection Management

**Branch**: `002-1-2-3` | **Date**: 2025-10-14 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)  
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-1-2-3/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Deliver multi-device persistence and auto-reconnection so users can save named controllers, manage them centrally, and rely on continuous foreground scanning to restore connections without manual intervention. Technical approach revolves around extending local persistence for saved devices, coordinating BLE scanning/retry loops, and updating UI state propagation for multiple controllers.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Dart (Flutter 3.x)  
**Primary Dependencies**: `flutter_blue_plus`, `provider`, `shared_preferences`  
**Storage**: Local key-value persistence via `shared_preferences`  
**Testing**: Flutter widget, unit, and integration suites using `flutter_test`  
**Target Platform**: Mobile (Android / iOS)  
**Project Type**: Mobile application with BLE device control  
**Performance Goals**: Maintain responsive UI while scanning; reconnect saved controllers within 20 seconds target  
**Constraints**: BLE scanning limited to foreground per platform policies; need graceful handling of multiple simultaneous connections; retries must avoid draining battery  
**Scale/Scope**: Support at least five saved controllers concurrently as per spec assumption

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Pre-Phase 0: Constitution file lacks concrete principles; proceed with documented assumption from research that no additional gates apply until governance updates the document.
- Post-Phase 1 review: No new governance guidance discovered; assumption remains valid.

**Structure Decision**: Existing Flutter mobile app structure under `app/lib` hosts models, services, providers, and UI; new feature work will extend these directories without introducing new top-level modules.
